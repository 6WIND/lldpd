<b><span class="caps">DESCRIPTION</span></b>
     <b>lldpd</b> is a daemon able to receive and send <u><span class="caps">LLDP</span></u> frames. The Link Layer
     Discovery Protocol is a vendor-neutral Layer 2 protocol that allows a
     network device to advertise its identity and capabilities on the local
     network.

     <b>lldpd</b> also implements an <span class="caps">SNMP</span> subagent using AgentX protocol to inter-
     face to a regular <span class="caps">SNMP</span> agent like Net-<span class="caps">SNMP</span>. To enable this subagent,
     you need something like that in your snmpd.conf(5):

           master agentx

     This daemon implements both reception and sending. It will collect var-
     ious information to send <span class="caps">LLDP</span> frames to all Ethernet interfaces,
     including management address, speed and <span class="caps">VLAN</span> names.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-d</b>      Do not daemonize.  If this option is specified, <b>lldpd</b> will run
             in the foreground and log to <u>stderr</u>.  This option can be speci-
             fied many times to increase verbosity. When specified three
             times, debug logs will be enabled. They can be filtered with <b>-D</b>
             flag.

     <b>-D</b> <u>debug</u>
             This option allows the user to filter out debugging information
             by specifying allowed tokens. This option can be repeated sev-
             eral times to allow several tokens. This option must be com-
             bined with the <b>-d</b> flag to have some effect. Only debugging logs
             can be filtered. Here is a list of allowed tokens with their
             description:

                             same port.
                 <b>netlink</b>     Netlink subsystem.

     <b>-k</b>      Disable advertising of kernel release, version and machine.
             Kernel name (ie: Linux) will still be shared, and Inventory
             software version will be set to &#8216;Unknown&#8217;.

     <b>-S</b> <u>description</u>
             Override system description with the provided description. The
             default description is the kernel name, the node name, the ker-
             nel version, the build date and the architecture (except if you
             use the <b>-k</b> flag described above).

     <b>-P</b> <u>platform</u>
             Override the <span class="caps">CDP</span> platform name with the provided value. The
             default description is the kernel name (Linux).

     <b>-x</b>      Enable <span class="caps">SNMP</span> subagent.  With this option, <b>lldpd</b> will enable an
             <span class="caps">SNMP</span> subagent using AgentX protocol. This allows you to get
             information about local system and remote systems through <span class="caps">SNMP</span>.

     <b>-X</b> <u>socket</u>
             Enable <span class="caps">SNMP</span> subagent using the specified socket.  <b>lldpd</b> will
             enable an <span class="caps">SNMP</span> subagent using AgentX protocol for the given
             socket. This option implies the previous one. The default
             socket is usally <u>/var/agentx/master</u>.  You can specify a socket
             like <u>tcp:127.0.0.1:705</u> for example. Since the process that will
             open this socket is enclosed in a chroot, you need to specify
             an <span class="caps">IP</span> address (not a hostname) when using a <span class="caps">TCP</span> or <span class="caps">UDP</span> socket.

     <b>-c</b>      Enable the support of <span class="caps">CDP</span> protocol to deal with Cisco routers
             that do not speak <span class="caps">LLDP</span>. If repeated, CDPv1 packets will be sent
             even when there is no <span class="caps">CDP</span> peer detected. If repeated once
             again, CDPv2 packets will be sent even when there is no <span class="caps">CDP</span>
             peer detected.

     <b>-f</b>      Enable the support of <span class="caps">FDP</span> protocol to deal with Foundry routers
             that do not speak <span class="caps">LLDP</span>. If repeated, <span class="caps">FDP</span> packets will be sent
             even when there is no <span class="caps">FDP</span> peer detected.

     <b>-s</b>      Enable the support of <span class="caps">SONMP</span> protocol to deal with Nortel
             routers and switches that do not speak <span class="caps">LLDP</span>. If repeated, <span class="caps">SONMP</span>
             packets will be sent even when there is no <span class="caps">SONMP</span> peer detected.

     <b>-e</b>      Enable the support of <span class="caps">EDP</span> protocol to deal with Extreme routers
             and switches that do not speak <span class="caps">LLDP</span>. If repeated, <span class="caps">EDP</span> packets
             will be sent even when there is no <span class="caps">EDP</span> peer detected.

     <b>-l</b>      Force to send <span class="caps">LLDP</span> packets even when there is no <span class="caps">LLDP</span> peer
             detected but there is a peer speaking another protocol
             detected. By default, <span class="caps">LLDP</span> packets are sent when there is a
             peer speaking <span class="caps">LLDP</span> detected or when there is no peer at all. If
             repeated, <span class="caps">LLDP</span> is disabled.

     <b>-r</b>      Receive-only mode. With this switch, <b>lldpd</b> will not send any
             frame. It will only listen to neighbors.

     <b>-m</b> <u>management</u>
             Specify the management addresses of this system. As for inter-
             faces (described below), this option can use wildcards and
             inversions.  Without this option, the first IPv4 and the first
             IPv6 are used. If only negative patterns are provided, only one
             IPv4 and one IPv6 addresses are chosen. Otherwise, many of them
             can be selected. If you want to blacklist IPv6 addresses, you
             can use <u>!*:*</u>.

     <b>-u</b> <u>file</u>
             Specify the Unix-domain socket used for communication with
             lldpctl(8).

     <b>-I</b> <u>interfaces</u>
             Specify which interface to listen to. Without this option,
             <b>lldpd</b> will listen on all available interfaces. This option can
             use wildcards. Several interfaces can be specified separated by
             commas.  It is also possible to blacklist an interface by suf-
             fixing it with an exclamation mark. When an interface is both
             specified with and without an exclamation mark, it is black-
             listed. For example, with <u>eth*,!eth1,!eth2</u> <b>lldpd</b> will only lis-
             ten to interfaces starting by <u>eth</u> with the exception of <u>eth1</u>
             and <u>eth2</u>.

     <b>-C</b> <u>interfaces</u>
             Specify which interfaces to use for computing chassis <span class="caps">ID</span>. With-
             out this option, all interfaces are considered.  <b>lldpd</b> will
             take the first <span class="caps">MAC</span> address from all the considered interfaces
             to compute the chassis <span class="caps">ID</span>. The logic of this option is the same
             as for <b>-I</b> flag: you can exclude interfaces with an exclamation
             mark and use globbing to specify several interfaces. If all
             interfaces are blacklisted (with <u>!*</u>), the system name is used
             as a chassis <span class="caps">ID</span> instead.

     <b>-M</b> <u>class</u>
             Enable emission of <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> frame. The class should be one of
             the following value:
             <b>1</b>     Generic Endpoint (Class I)
             <b>2</b>     Media Endpoint (Class <span class="caps">II</span>)
             <b>3</b>     Communication Device Endpoints (Class <span class="caps">III</span>)
             <b>4</b>     Network Connectivity Device

     <b>-i</b>      Disable <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> inventory <span class="caps">TLV</span> transmission.  <b>lldpd</b> will still
             receive (and publish using <span class="caps">SNMP</span> if enabled) those <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> <span class="caps">TLV</span>
             but will not send them. Use this option if you don&#8217;t want to
             transmit sensible information like serial numbers.

     <b>-H</b> <u>hide</u>
             Filter neighbors. See section <u><span class="caps">FILTERING</span></u> <u><span class="caps">NEIGHBORS</span></u> for details.

     <b>-L</b> <u>lldpcli</u>
             Provide an alternative path to <b>lldpcli</b> for configuration. If
             empty, does not use <b>lldpcli</b> for configuration.

     <b>-v</b>      Show <b>lldpd</b> version.

<b><span class="caps">FILTERING</span></b> <b><span class="caps">NEIGHBORS</span></b>
     In a heterogeneous network, you may see several different hosts on the
     same port, even if there is only one physically plugged to this port.
     For example, if you have a Nortel switch running <span class="caps">LLDP</span> which is plugged
     to a Cisco switch running <span class="caps">CDP</span> and your host is plugged to the Cisco
     switch, you will see the Nortel switch as well because <span class="caps">LLDP</span> frames are
     forwarded by the Cisco switch. This may not be what you want. The <b>-H</b>
     <u>hide</u> parameter will allow you to tell <b>lldpd</b> to discard some frames that
     it receives and to avoid to send some other frames.

     Incoming filtering and outgoing filtering are unrelated. Incoming fil-
     tering will hide some remote ports to get you a chance to know exactly
     what equipment is on the other side of the network cable. Outgoing fil-
     tering will avoid to use some protocols to avoid flooding your network
     with a protocol that is not handled by the nearest equipment. Keep in
     mind that even without filtering, <b>lldpd</b> will speak protocols for which
     at least one frame has been received and <span class="caps">LLDP</span> otherwise (there are
     other options to change this behaviour, for example <b>-cc</b>, <b>-ss</b>, <b>-ee</b>, <b>-ll</b>
     and <b>-ff</b> ).

     When enabling incoming filtering, <b>lldpd</b> will try to select one protocol
     and filter out neighbors using other protocols. To select this proto-
     col, the rule is to take the less used protocol. If on one port, you
     get 12 <span class="caps">CDP</span> neighbors and 1 <span class="caps">LLDP</span> neighbor, this mean that the remote
     switch speaks <span class="caps">LLDP</span> and does not filter <span class="caps">CDP</span>. Therefore, we select <span class="caps">LLDP</span>.
     When enabling outgoing filtering, <b>lldpd</b> will also try to select one
     protocol and only speaks this protocol. The filtering is done per port.
     Each port may select a different protocol.

     There are two additional criteria when enabling filtering: allowing one
     or several protocols to be selected (in case of a tie) and allowing one
     or several neighbors to be selected. Even when allowing several proto-
     cols, the rule of selecting the protocols with the less neighbors still
     apply. If <b>lldpd</b> selects <span class="caps">LLDP</span> and <span class="caps">CDP</span>, this means they have the same
     number of neighbors. The selection of the neighbor is random. Incoming
     filtering will select a set of neighbors to be displayed while outgoing
     filtering will use the selected set of neighbors to decide which proto-
     cols to use: if a selected neighbor speaks <span class="caps">LLDP</span> and another one <span class="caps">CDP</span>,
     <b>lldpd</b> will speak both <span class="caps">CDP</span> and <span class="caps">LLDP</span> on this port.

     There are some corner cases. A typical example is a switch speaking two
     protocols (<span class="caps">CDP</span> and <span class="caps">LLDP</span> for example). You want to get the information
     from the best protocol but you want to speak both protocols because
     some tools use the <span class="caps">CDP</span> table and some other the <span class="caps">LLDP</span> table.

     The table below summarize all accepted values for the <b>-H</b> <u>hide</u> parame-
     ter. The default value is <u>15</u> which corresponds to the corner case
     described above. The <u>filter</u> column means that filtering is enabled. The
     <u>1proto</u> column tells that only one protocol will be kept. The <u>1neigh</u>
     column tells that only one neighbor will be kept.

<b><span class="caps">SYNOPSIS</span></b>
     <b>lldpcli</b> [<b>-dv</b>] [<b>-u</b> <u>file</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>file</u>] [<u>command</u> <u>&#8230;</u>]

<b><span class="caps">DESCRIPTION</span></b>
     The <b>lldpcli</b> program controls lldpd(8) daemon.

     When no command is specified, <b>lldpcli</b> will start an interactive shell
     which can be used to input arbitrary commands as if they were specified
     on the command line. This interactive shell should provide completion
     and history support.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-d</b>      Enable more debugging information.

     <b>-u</b>      Specify the Unix-domain socket used for communication with
             lldpd(8).

     <b>-v</b>      Show <b>lldpcli</b> version.

     <b>-f</b> <u>format</u>
             Choose the output format. Currently <u>plain</u>, <u>xml</u>, <u>json</u> and
             <u>keyvalue</u> formats are available. The default is <u>plain</u>.

     <b>-c</b> <u>file</u>
             Read the given configuration file. This option may be repeated
             several times. If a directory is provided, each file contained
             in it will be read  if ending by .conf.  Order is alphabetical.

     When invoked as <b>lldpctl</b>, <b>lldpcli</b> will display detailed information
     about each neighbors on the specified interfaces or on all interfaces
     if none are specified. This command is mostly kept for backward compat-
     ibility with older versions.

     The following commands are supported by <b>lldpcli</b>.  When there is no
     ambiguity, the keywords can be abbreviated. For example, <b>show</b> <b>neighbors</b>
     <b>ports</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>summary</b> and <b>sh</b> <b>neigh</b> <b>p</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>sum</b> are the same command.

       <b>exit</b>

             Quit <b>lldpcli</b>.

       <b>help</b> [&#8230;]

             Display general help or help about a command. Also, you can get
             help using the completion or by pressing the ?  key. However,
             completion and inline help may be unavailable if <b>lldpcli</b> was
             compiled without readline support but <b>help</b> command is always
             available.

       <b>show</b> <b>neighbors</b> [ports <u>ethX</u> [,&#8230;]] [<b>details</b> | <b>summary</b>] [<b>hidden</b>]

             Display information about each neighbor known by lldpd(8) dae-
             mon. With <b>summary</b>, only a the name and the port description of
             each remote host will be displayed. On the other hand, with
             <b>details</b>, all available information will be displayed, giving a
             verbose view. When using <b>hidden</b>, also display remote ports hid-
             den by the smart filter. When specifying one or several ports,
             the information displayed is limited to the given list of
             ports.

       <b>watch</b> [ports <u>ethX</u> [,&#8230;]] [<b>details</b> | <b>summary</b>] [<b>hidden</b>]

             Watch for any neighbor changes and report them as soon as they
             happen. When specifying ports, the changes are only reported
             when happening on the given ports.  <b>hidden</b>, <b>summary</b> and <b>details</b>
             have the same meaning than previously described.

       <b>show</b> <b>configuration</b>

             Display global configuration of lldpd(8) daemon.

       <b>show</b> <b>statistics</b> [ports <u>ethX</u> [,&#8230;]] [<b>summary</b>]

             Report <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-related statistics, like the number of <span class="caps">LLDPDU</span>
             transmitted, received, discarded or unrecognized. When specify-
             ing ports, only the statistics from the given port are
             reported. With <b>summary</b> the statistics of each port is summed.

       <b>update</b>

             Make lldpd(8) update its information and send new <span class="caps">LLDP</span> <span class="caps">PDU</span> on
             all interfaces.

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>description</b> <u>description</u>

             Override chassis description with the provided value instead of
             using kernel name, node name, kernel version, build date and
             architecture.

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>platform</b> <u>description</u>

             Override platform description with the provided value instead
             of using kernel name. This value is currently only used for
             <span class="caps">CDP</span>.

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>interface</b> <b>pattern</b> <u>pattern</u>

             Set the pattern of valid interfaces to use. When not set, <b>lldpd</b>
             will listen on all available interfaces. This option can use
             wildcards. Several interfaces can be specified separated by
             commas.  It is also possible to blacklist an interface by suf-
             fixing it with an exclamation mark. When an interface is both
             specified with and without an exclamation mark, it is black-
             listed. For example, with <u>eth*,!eth1,!eth2</u> <b>lldpd</b> will only lis-
             ten to interfaces starting by <u>eth</u> with the exception of <u>eth1</u>
             and <u>eth2</u>.

       <b>configure</b> <b>lldp</b> <b>tx-interval</b> <u>interval</u>

             Change transmit delay to the specified value in seconds. The
             transmit delay is the delay between two transmissions of <span class="caps">LLDP</span>
             <span class="caps">PDU</span>. The default value is 30 seconds.

       <b>configure</b> <b>lldp</b> <b>tx-hold</b> <u>hold</u>

             Change transmit hold value to the specified value. This value
             is used to compute the <span class="caps">TTL</span> of transmitted packets which is the
             product of this value and of the transmit delay. The default
             value is 4 and therefore the default <span class="caps">TTL</span> is 120 seconds.

       <b>configure</b> <b>med</b> <b>fast-start</b> <b>enable</b> | <b>tx-interval</b> <u>interval</u>

             Configure <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> fast start mechanism. When a new <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span>-
             enabled neighbor is detected, fast start allows <b>lldpd</b> to
             shorten the interval between two <span class="caps">LLDPDU</span>.  <b>enable</b> should enable
             <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> fast start while <b>tx-interval</b> specifies the interval
             between two <span class="caps">LLDPDU</span> in seconds. The default interval is 1 sec-
             ond. Once 4 <span class="caps">LLDPDU</span> have been sent, the fast start mechanism is
             disabled until a new neighbor is detected.

       <b>unconfigure</b> <b>med</b> <b>fast-start</b>

             Disable <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> fast start mechanism.

       <b>configure</b> [ports <u>ethX</u> [,&#8230;]] <b>med</b> <b>location</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>latitude</b>
       <u>latitude</u> <b>longitude</b> <u>longitude</u> <b>altitude</b> <u>altitude</u> <u>unit</u> <b>datum</b> <u>datum</u>

             Advertise a coordinate based location on the given ports (or on
             all ports if no port is specified). The format of <u>latitude</u> is a
             decimal floating point number followed either by <u>N</u> or <u>S</u>.  The
             format of <u>longitude</u> is a decimal floating point number followed
             either by <u>E</u> or <u>W</u>.  <u>altitude</u> is a decimal floating point number
             followed either by <u>m</u> when expressed in meters or <u>f</u> when
             expressed in floors. A space is expected between the floating
             point number and the unit.  <u>datum</u> is one of those values:
                     &raquo;   <span class="caps">WGS84</span>
                     &raquo;   <span class="caps">NAD83</span>
                     &raquo;   <span class="caps">NAD83</span>/<span class="caps">MLLW</span>

             A valid use of this command is:

       [<u>type</u> <u>value</u> [&#8230;]]

             Advertise a civic address on the given ports (or on all ports
             if no port is specified).  <u>country</u> is the two-letter code rep-
             resenting the country. The remaining arguments should be paired
             to form the address. The first member of each pair indicates
             the type of the second member which is a free-form text. Here
             is the list of valid types:

                   &#8220;Commercial Road&#8221; city &#8220;Roseville&#8221;

       <b>configure</b> [ports <u>ethX</u> [,&#8230;]] <b>med</b> <b>location</b> <b>elin</b> <u>number</u>

             Advertise the availability of an <span class="caps">ELIN</span> number. This is used for
             setting up emergency call. If the provided number is too small,
             it will be padded with 0. Here is an example of use:
                   configure ports eth2 med location elin 911

       <b>configure</b> [ports <u>ethX</u> [,&#8230;]] <b>med</b> <b>policy</b> <b>application</b> <u>application</u>
       [<b>unknown</b>] [<b>vlan</b> <u>vlan</u>] [<b>priority</b> <u>priority</u>] [<b>dscp</b> <u>dscp</u>]

             Advertise a specific network policy for the given ports (or for
             all ports if no port was provided). Only the application type
             is mandatory.  <u>application</u> should be one of the following val-
             ues: static const struct value_string port_med_policy_map[] = {
                     &raquo;   voice

                     &raquo;   video-signaling

             The <b>unknown</b> flag tells that the network policy for the speci-
             fied application type is required by the device but is cur-
             rently unknown. This is used by Endpoint Devices, not by Net-
             work Connectivity Devices. If not specified, the network policy
             for the given application type is defined.

             When a <span class="caps">VLAN</span> is specified with <b>vlan</b> tells which 802.1q <span class="caps">VLAN</span> <span class="caps">ID</span>
             has to be advertised for the network policy. A valid value is
             between 1 and 4094.  <b>priority</b> allows one to specify <span class="caps">IEEE</span> 802.1d
             / <span class="caps">IEEE</span> 802.1p Layer 2 Priority, also known as Class of Service
             (CoS), to be used for the specified application type. It should
             be one of those values:
                     &raquo;   background
                     &raquo;   spare
                     &raquo;   best-effort

                     &raquo;   voice
                     &raquo;   network-control

             <u>dscp</u> represents the <span class="caps">DSCP</span> value to be advertised for the given
             network policy.  DiffServ/Differentiated Services Code Point
             (<span class="caps">DSCP</span>) value as defined in <span class="caps">IETF</span> <span class="caps">RFC</span> 2474 for the specified
             application type. Value: 0 (default per <span class="caps">RFC</span> 2475) through 63.
             Note: The class selector <span class="caps">DSCP</span> values are backwards compatible
             for devices that only support the old <span class="caps">IP</span> precedence Type of
             Service (ToS) format. (See the RFCs for what these values mean)

             A valid use of this command is:

             Advertise the <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> <span class="caps">POE</span>-<span class="caps">MDI</span> <span class="caps">TLV</span> for the given ports or for
             all interfaces if no port is provided.  One can act as a <span class="caps">PD</span>
             (power consumer) or a <span class="caps">PSE</span> (power provider). No check is done on
             the validity of the parameters while <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> requires some
             restrictions:

             &raquo;   <span class="caps">PD</span> shall never request more power than physical 802.3af
                 class.

             &raquo;   <span class="caps">PD</span> shall never draw more than the maximum power advertised
                 by <span class="caps">PSE</span>.

             &raquo;   <span class="caps">PSE</span> shall not reduce power allocated to <span class="caps">PD</span> when this power
                 is in use.

             &raquo;   <span class="caps">PSE</span> may request reduced power using conservation mode

             &raquo;   Being <span class="caps">PSE</span> or <span class="caps">PD</span> is a global paremeter, not a per-port
                 parameter.  <b>lldpcli</b> does not enforce this: a port can be
                 set as <span class="caps">PD</span> or <span class="caps">PSE</span>. <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> also requires for a <span class="caps">PSE</span> to only
                 have one power source (primary or backup). Again, <b>lldpcli</b>
                 does not enforce this. Each port can have its own power
                 source. The same applies for <span class="caps">PD</span> and power priority. <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-
                 <span class="caps">MED</span> <span class="caps">MIB</span> does not allow this kind of representation.

             Valid types are:

               <b>pd</b>    Power Device (power consumer)

             Valid sources are:

               <b>primary</b>  For <span class="caps">PSE</span>, the power source is the primary power
                        source.
               <b>backup</b>   For <span class="caps">PSE</span>, the power source is the backup power source
                        or a power conservation mode is asked (the <span class="caps">PSE</span> may
                        be running on <span class="caps">UPS</span> for example).
               <b>pse</b>      For <span class="caps">PD</span>, the power source is the <span class="caps">PSE</span>.

             but the user should ensure the coherency of those two configu-
             rations if they are used together.

             <u>supported</u> means that <span class="caps">MDI</span> power is supported on the given port
             while <u>enabled</u> means that <span class="caps">MDI</span> power is enabled.  <u>paircontrol</u> is
             used to indicate if pair selection can be controlled. Valid
             values forr <u>powerpairs</u> are:
               <b>signal</b>  The signal pairs only are in use.
               <b>spare</b>   The spare pairs only are in use.

             When specified, <u>class</u> is a number between 0 and 4.
